# TEG-Blue™ Collaboration Guidelines  

The **TEG-Blue Research Integration Repository** is a shared space where science, ethics, and lived experience meet.  
Collaboration here is built not only on intellectual rigor, but on **emotional safety, reciprocity, and transparency**.

---

### **1. Core Principles**

Every contribution is guided by three simple principles:

1. **Emotional safety before productivity**  
   We prioritize care, clarity, and respect before deadlines or output.  
   Emotional safety creates scientific integrity.

2. **Transparency over hierarchy**  
   Every voice is equal in the pursuit of truth.  
   We name what we see, question what we inherit, and stay accountable to what we create.

3. **Repair over perfection**  
   Mistakes are part of the process. What matters is how we repair and grow through them.

### **2. Authorship and Attribution**

- All research and tools developed within this repository must **acknowledge their integration with TEG-Blue™**.  
- **Anna Maria Paretas Artacho** remains the lead author of the TEG-Blue emotional framework and its derivatives.  
- Co-authors and contributors are credited directly in the Research Matrix or Tool Library files.  
- External researchers retain full academic ownership of their studies while recognizing the **shared logic and infrastructure** they build upon.

### **3. Contributing New Work**

You can contribute in three main ways:

1. **Add a new research line**  
   Expand the `TEG-Blue_Research_Matrix.csv` with your proposed study, using the same column format.  
   Include references and frameworks connected to your hypothesis.

2. **Add or adapt a tool**  
   Update the `TEG-Blue_Tool_Library.csv` with new or modified instruments, scales, or visual frameworks.  
   Include validation status and intended context of use.

3. **Propose documentation or analysis**  
   Add supporting Markdown files to `/docs/` with new insights, validation reports, or interpretive notes.

Before submitting a pull request, please ensure your contribution:
- Honors the emotional and ethical foundation of TEG-Blue.  
- Avoids using the material for profit, manipulation, or diagnostic claims.  
- Uses **plain, accessible language** — emotional clarity is part of scientific rigor.

### **4. Ethical Ground**

We recognize that research involving emotions, trauma, and identity requires deep responsibility.  
All collaborators are expected to:

- Respect privacy and informed consent.  
- Use language that avoids stigmatization or superiority.  
- Disclose potential conflicts of interest.  
- Engage in honest dialogue about uncertainty, disagreement, and emotional impact.

This repository is a **learning space**, not a hierarchy.  
It’s where emotional intelligence and academic precision evolve together.
