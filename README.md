# TEG-Blue_Research_Matrix
A collaborative research hub connecting TEG-Blue’s emotional frameworks with global models. Includes the Research Matrix and Tool Library for validation studies, emotional logic mapping, and trauma-informed AI alignment.

# TEG-Blue™ — Research Integration Repository  
**Emotional Technology for Healing and Repair**

### **Purpose**

This repository gathers the **Research Matrix** and **Tool Library** that connect all collaborative studies within the TEG-Blue ecosystem — a living emotional framework created by **Anna Maria Paretas Artacho**.

TEG-Blue is a **trauma-informed, neurodivergent-friendly, and AI-aligned system** that maps emotional logic across individuals, relationships, and society.  
This space is meant to bridge scientific inquiry, emotional intelligence, and ethical design.

### **What You’ll Find Here**

** `/data/`**  
- `TEG-Blue_Research_Matrix.csv` — list of active and proposed research lines, showing how each connects to TEG-Blue frameworks and global models.  
- `TEG-Blue_Tool_Library.csv` — catalog of open tools and emotional scales available for replication, testing, or integration.

** `/docs/`**  
- `Research_Matrix_Overview.md` — how the matrix is structured and how to contribute to new research lines.  
- `Tool_Library_Overview.md` — structure, validation notes, and cross-references with the emotional frameworks.  
- `Collaboration_Guidelines.md` — co-authorship, attribution, and ethical collaboration principles.

### **How Collaboration Works**

Every research line or tool can be:  
- **Replicated or expanded** under your own academic or clinical framework.  
- **Co-authored with Anna Paretas** to preserve systemic consistency and emotional logic.  
- **Integrated into** larger cross-disciplinary or AI-related studies.

The goal is to create **shared authorship** — where scientific rigor meets emotional coherence.

### **Ethical & Emotional Ground**

This project is built on three principles:  
1. **Emotional safety before productivity.**  
2. **Transparency over hierarchy.**  
3. **Repair over perfection.**

We invite contributions that honor lived experience, rigorous thinking, and collective evolution.
