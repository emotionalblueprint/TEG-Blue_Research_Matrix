# TEG-Blue_Research_Matrix  
### *Part of TEG-Blue™ — Emotional Technology for Healing and Repair*

A collaborative research hub connecting **TEG-Blue’s emotional frameworks** with global models.  
Includes the **Research Matrix** and **Tool Library** for validation studies, emotional logic mapping, and trauma-informed AI alignment.

## Purpose

This repository gathers the **Research Matrix** and **Tool Library** that connect all collaborative studies within the **TEG-Blue ecosystem** — a living emotional framework created by **Anna Maria Paretas Artacho**.

TEG-Blue is a **trauma-informed, neurodivergent-friendly, and AI-aligned system** that maps emotional logic across individuals, relationships, and society.  
This space exists to bridge **scientific inquiry**, **emotional intelligence**, and **ethical design**.

## How Collaboration Works

Every research line or tool can be:

- **Replicated or expanded** under your own academic or clinical framework.  
- **Co-authored with Anna Paretas** to preserve systemic consistency and emotional logic.  
- **Integrated into** larger cross-disciplinary or AI-related studies.

The goal is **shared authorship** — where scientific rigor meets emotional coherence.  

If you wish to join the validation phase or propose a study, please reach out through the main site:

## Ethical & Emotional Ground

This project is built on three guiding principles:

1. **Emotional safety before productivity**  
   Grounded collaboration requires care, clarity, and respect.  

2. **Transparency over hierarchy**  
   Every voice matters. We name what we see, and stay accountable to what we create.  

3. **Repair over perfection**  
   Progress means learning, not performing. Mistakes are part of growth.  

We invite contributions that honor lived experience, rigorous thinking, and collective evolution.
